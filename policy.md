# Privacy Policy

Effective date: March 21st, 2024

At Pauli Group, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. Our services, including the blockchain wallet, do not currently collect any personal data from our users, such as names, addresses, email addresses, and payment information.

## Blockchain Transactions
Please be aware that due to the inherent nature of blockchain technology, transactions made through our blockchain wallet are public and can be viewed on the blockchain by anyone. While these transactions do not directly disclose your personal information, they are permanently recorded on the blockchain and can include details such as the transaction amount, wallet addresses, and the time of the transaction. We encourage our users to understand the public aspect of blockchain transactions and to use our services with this in mind.

Should our data collection practices change at any time in the future, we will promptly update this privacy policy to reflect those changes. We encourage our users to review our privacy policy periodically to stay informed of any updates.

For any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please contact us at [Discord Invite Link](https://discord.com/invite/JAEC8pgWFV).

Pauli Group reserves the right to amend this privacy policy at any time.
